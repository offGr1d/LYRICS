    <h1>Stay</h1>
    <h2>Song by Justin Bieber and The Kid LAROI</h2>
    <p>I do the same thing, I told you that I never would <br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
            I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
            I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
            I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
            I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, yeah<br>
            When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh-ooh)<br>
            You're the reason I believe in love<br>
            It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh)<br>
            And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
            Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
            'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed<br>
            And you know that I know that I can't live without you<br>
            So, baby, stay<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, whoa)<br>
            I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
            I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, yeah<br>
            I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            Whoa-oh<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey</p><br>
