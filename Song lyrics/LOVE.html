            I'm on the way, I know connection is vague<br>
            Pick up the phone for me, babe (love me)<br>
            Dammit, we jammin'<br>
            Bad attitude from your nanny<br>
            Curves and your hips from yo' mammy<br>
            Remember Gardena? I took the studio camera<br>
            I know Top will be mad at me<br>
            I had to do it, I want your body, your music<br>
            I bought the big one to prove it<br>
            Look what you made<br>
            Told you that I'm on the way<br>
            I'm like an exit away, yep<br>
            If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?<br>
            If I made up my mind at work, would you still (love me)?<br>
            Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)<br>
            Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothin' (oh, oh)<br>
            Give me a run for my money<br>
            There is nobody, no one to outrun me<br>
            So give me a run for my money<br>
            Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely<br>
            Livin' lovely<br>
            Just love me<br>
            I wanna be with you, ayy (just love me)<br>
            I wanna be with (just love me, just love)<br>
            I wanna be with you, ayy (love me), I wanna be with<br>
