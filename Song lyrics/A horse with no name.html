    <h1>A Horse with No Name</h1>
    <h2>Song by America</h2>
    <p>On the first part of the journey<br>
            I was looking at all the life<br>
            There were plants and birds and rocks and things<br>
            There was sand and hills and rings<br>
            The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz<br>
            And the sky with no clouds<br>
            The heat was hot and the ground was dry<br>
            But the air was full of sound<br>
            I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
            It felt good to be out of the rain<br>
            In the desert you can't remember your name<br>
            'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain<br>
            La la la la la la...<br>
            After two days in the desert sun<br>
            My skin began to turn red<br>
            And after three days in the desert fun<br>
            I was looking at a river bed<br>
            And the story it told of a river that flowed<br>
            Made me sad to think it was dead<br>
            You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
            It felt good to be out of the rain<br>
            In the desert you can't remember your name<br>
            'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain<br>
            La la la la la la...<br>
            After nine days I let the horse run free<br>
            'Cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
            There were plants and birds and rocks and things<br>
            There was sand and hills and rings<br>
            The ocean is a desert with its life underground<br>
            And a perfect disguise above<br>
            Under the cities lies a heart made of ground<br>
            But the humans will give no love<br>
            You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
            It felt good to be out of the rain<br>
            In the desert you can't remember your name<br>
            'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain<br>
            La la la la la la...<br>
            Thank you all very much<br>
            Take care of yourselves, take care</p><br>
