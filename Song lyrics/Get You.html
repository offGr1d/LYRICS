    <h1>Get You</h1>
    <h2>Song by Daniel Caesar</h2>
    <p>Through drought and famine, natural disasters <br>
            My baby has been around for me<br>
            Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling<br>
            None of that could ever make me leave<br>
            Every time I look into your eyes I see it<br>
            You're all I need<br>
            Every time I get a bit inside I feel it<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?<br>
            And when we're making love<br>
            Your cries they can be heard from far and wide<br>
            It's only the two of us<br>
            Everything I need's between those thighs<br>
            Every time I look into your eyes I see it<br>
            You're all I need<br>
            Every time I get a bit inside I feel it<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?<br>
            Oh yeah, oh yeah babe<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?<br>
            And I'll take some time<br>
            Just to be thankful<br>
            That I had days full of you, you<br>
            Before it winds down into<br>
            The memories, it's all just memories<br>
            La-la-la-la-la<br>
            If you've got someone you like<br>
            (Don't you love when I come around)<br>
            Somebody just tell somebody<br>
            If you've got someone you like<br>
            Feel something that's right<br>
            Somebody just tell somebody (build you up then I take)<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?<br>
            (Oh yeah, oh yeah babe)<br>
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you<br>
            This feels like summer<br>
            Boy you make me feel so alive<br>
            Just be my lover<br>
            Boy you'll lead me to paradise</p>
