    <h1>Sunflower</h1>
    <h2>Song by Post Malone and Swae Lee</h2>
    <p>Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh) <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)<br>
            Ayy, ayy<br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
            Needless to say, I keep her in check<br>
            She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)<br>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)<br>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)<br>
            Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check<br>
            She was all bad-bad, nevertheless<br>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck<br>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck<br>
            Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip<br>
            Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip<br>
            Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt<br>
            Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt<br>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            Some things you just can't refuse<br>
            She wanna ride me like a cruise<br>
            And I'm not tryna lose<br>
            Then you're left in the dust<br>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br>
            You're the sunflower<br>
            I think your love would be too much<br>
            Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br>
            You're the sunflower<br>
            You're the sunflower<br>
            Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)<br>
            You don't make it easy, no (no, no)<br>
            Wish I could be there for you<br>
            Give me a reason to, oh (oh)<br>
            Every time I'm walkin' out<br>
            I can hear you tellin' me to turn around<br>
            Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down<br>
            Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)<br>
            I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)<br>
            You don't wanna be alone (alone)<br>
            I know I always come and go (and go)<br>
            But it's out of my control<br>
            And you'll be left in the dust<br>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br>
            You're the sunflower<br>
            I think your love would be too much<br>
            Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br>
            You're the sunflower<br>
            You're the sunflower (yeah)</p><br>
